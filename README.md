# A-Model-Free-Toolface-Control-Strategy-for-Cross-Well-Intelligent-Directional-Drilling
This code belongs to research paper entitled as "A Model-Free Toolface Control Strategy for Cross-Well Intelligent Directional Drilling".

This paper proposes a model-free online learning-based adaptive decision approach to the directional drilling toolface, which enables self-study and applicability in complex downhole environments.
